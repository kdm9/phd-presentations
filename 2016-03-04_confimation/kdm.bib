	abstract = {Author {SummaryRecent} advances in sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale surveys of genetic diversity in model species with a wholly or partly sequenced reference genome. However, thousands of key species, which are essential for food, health, energy, and ecology, do not have reference genomes. To accelerate their breeding cycle via marker assisted selection, high-throughput genotyping is required for these valuable species, in spite of the absence of reference genomes. Based on genotyping by sequencing ({GBS}) technology, we developed a new single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) discovery protocol, the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit ({UNEAK}), which can be widely used in any species, regardless of genome complexity or the availability of a reference genome. Here we test this protocol on switchgrass, currently the prime energy crop species in the United States of America. In addition to the discovery of over a million {SNPs} and construction of high-density linkage maps, we provide novel insights into the genome complexity, ploidy, phylogeny, and evolution of switchgrass. This is only the beginning: we believe {UNEAK} offers the key to the exploration and exploitation of the genetic diversity of thousands of non-model species.},

	abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.

Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

	abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of {DNA} sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing {GBS} libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes ({REs}). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive {REs}, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The {GBS} procedure is demonstrated with maize ({IBM}) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of {GBS} to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

	abstract = {Summary: Suffix tree is one of the most fundamental data structures in string algorithms and biological sequence analysis. Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing those algorithms and applying them to real genomic sequences, often the main memory size becomes the bottleneck. This is easily explained by the fact that while a {DNA} sequence of length n from alphabet Σ = \{A, C, G, T \} can be stored in n log {\textbar}Σ{\textbar}= 2n bits, its suffix tree occupies O(n log n) bits. In practice, the size difference easily reaches factor 50.
We provide an implementation of the compressed suffix tree very recently proposed by Sadakane (Theory of Computing Systems, in press). The compressed suffix tree occupies space proportional to the text size, and supports all typical suffix tree operations with at most log n factor slowdown. Our experiments show that, e.g. on a 10 {MB} {DNA} sequence, the compressed suffix tree takes 10\% of the space of normal suffix tree. Typical operations are slowed down by factor 60.
Availability: The C++ implementation under {GNU} license is available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds/cst/. An example program implementing a typical pattern discovery task is included. Experimental results in this note correspond to version 0.95.

As non-model organisms are increasingly investigated, the need for reference-free methods has been amplified. Most of the existing reference-free methods have fundamental limitations: they can only call {SNPs} between exactly two datasets, and/or they require a prohibitive amount of computational resources. The method we propose, {discoSnp}, detects both heterozygous and homozygous isolated {SNPs} from any number of read datasets, without a reference genome, and with very low memory and time footprints (billions of reads can be analyzed with a standard desktop computer). To facilitate downstream genotyping analyses, {discoSnp} ranks predictions and outputs quality and coverage per allele. Compared to finding isolated {SNPs} using a state-of-the-art assembly and mapping approach, {discoSnp} requires significantly less computational resources, shows similar precision/recall values, and highly ranked predictions are less likely to be false positives. An experimental validation was conducted on an arthropod species (the tick Ixodes ricinus) on which de novo sequencing was performed. Among the predicted {SNPs} that were tested, 96\% were successfully genotyped and truly exhibited polymorphism.},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is ∼10–20× faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of {tagSNPs}, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency {\textgreater}0.2\%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of {\textgreater}2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ∼20\% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

Our main result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},

	abstract = {Modern sequencing and genome assembly technologies have provided a wealth of data, which will soon require an analysis by comparison for discovery. Sequence alignment, a fundamental task in bioinformatics research, may be used but with some caveats. Seminal techniques and methods from dynamic programming are proving ineffective for this work owing to their inherent computational expense when processing large amounts of sequence data. These methods are prone to giving misleading information because of genetic recombination, genetic shuffling and other inherent biological events. New approaches from information theory, frequency analysis and data compression are available and provide powerful alternatives to dynamic programming. These new methods are often preferred, as their algorithms are simpler and are not affected by synteny-related problems.
In this review, we provide a detailed discussion of computational tools, which stem from alignment-free methods based on statistical analysis from word frequencies. We provide several clear examples to demonstrate applications and the interpretations over several different areas of alignment-free analysis such as base–base correlations, feature frequency profiles, compositional vectors, an improved string composition and the D2 statistic metric. Additionally, we provide detailed discussion and an example of analysis by Lempel–Ziv techniques from data compression.},

Stacks can generate markers for ultra-dense genetic linkage maps, facilitate the examination of population phylogeography, and help in reference genome assembly.

Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian {BACs}. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian {BAC}, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

Most organisms segregate large numbers of {DNA} sequence polymorphisms that disrupt restriction sites, which allows {RAD} tags to serve as genetic markers spread at a high density throughout the genome. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of {RAD} markers for both individual and bulk-segregant genotyping. First, we show that these markers can be identified and typed on pre-existing microarray formats. Second, we present a method that uses {RAD} marker {DNA} to rapidly produce a low-cost microarray genotyping resource that can be used to efficiently identify and type thousands of {RAD} markers. We demonstrate the utility of the former approach by using a tiling path array for the fruit fly to map a recombination breakpoint, and the latter approach by creating and using an enriched {RAD} marker array for the threespine stickleback. The high number of {RAD} markers enabled localization of a previously identified region, as well as a second region also associated with the lateral plate phenotype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that {RAD} markers, and the method to develop a {RAD} marker microarray resource, allow high-throughput, high-resolution genotyping in both model and nonmodel systems.},

To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via “{SNP} chip” microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as {RAD}-tag or {RADseq}) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current {SNP} chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input {DNA}, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified {RADseq} approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels).

	abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.
Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use ‘spaced words’, defined by patterns of ‘match’ and ‘don’t care’ positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.

	abstract = {We describe a novel method for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, based on sequences of whole genomes or proteomes, whose lengths may greatly vary. The core of our method is a new measure of pairwise distances between sequences. This measure is based on computing the average lengths of maximum common substrings, which is intrinsically related to information theoretic tools (Kullback–Leibler relative entropy). We present an algorithm for efficiently computing these distances. In principle, the distance of two l long sequences can be calculated in O(l) time. We implemented the algorithm using suffix arrays our implementation is fast enough to enable the construction of the proteome phylogenomic tree for hundreds of species and the genome phylogenomic forest for almost two thousand viruses. An initial analysis of the results exhibits a remarkable agreement with "acceptable phylogenetic and taxonomic truth." To assess our approach, our results were compared to the traditional (single-gene or protein-based) maximum likelihood method. The obtained trees were compared to implementations of a number of alternative approaches, including two that were previously published in the literature, and to the published results of a third approach. Comparing their outcome and running time to ours, using a "traditional" trees and a standard tree comparison method, our algorithm improved upon the "competition" by a substantial margin. The simplicity and speed of our method allows for a whole genome analysis with the greatest scope attempted so far. We describe here five different applications of the method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies have become the standard for data generation in studies of population genomics, as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of {NGS} data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five {HLA} genes ({HLA}-A, -B, -C, -{DRB}1, and -{DQB}1). We take advantage of the availability of {HLA} Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6\% of {SNP} genotype calls in {HLA} genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than ±0.1 at approximately 25\% of the {SNPs} in {HLA} genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the {HLA} region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of {NGS} data at other genomic regions of high diversity.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-based methods for sequence analysis have various limitations if large data sets are to be analysed. Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring ({ACS}) approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays.
Results: To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of {DNA} and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods which are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood.

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or l-mer) frequency profiles ({FFP}) of whole genomes are used for comparison—a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of l-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum {FFP} method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized {FFP} method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the {FFP} derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phylogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions.},

	abstract = {We performed whole-genome resequencing of 12 field isolates and eight commonly studied laboratory strains of the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to characterize genomic diversity and provide a resource for studies of natural variation. Our data support previous observations that Chlamydomonas is among the most diverse eukaryotic species. Nucleotide diversity is ∼3\% and is geographically structured in North America with some evidence of admixture among sampling locales. Examination of predicted loss-of-function mutations in field isolates indicates conservation of genes associated with core cellular functions, while genes in large gene families and poorly characterized genes show a greater incidence of major effect mutations. De novo assembly of unmapped reads recovered genes in the field isolates that are absent from the {CC}-503 assembly. The laboratory reference strains show a genomic pattern of polymorphism consistent with their origin as the recombinant progeny of a diploid zygospore. Large duplications or amplifications are a prominent feature of laboratory strains and appear to have originated under laboratory culture. Extensive natural variation offers a new source of genetic diversity for studies of Chlamydomonas, including naturally occurring alleles that may prove useful in studies of gene function and the dissection of quantitative genetic traits.},

	abstract = {K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo assembly, repeat detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the khmer software package for fast and memory efficient online counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch. The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, {BFCounter}, {DSK}, {KMC}, Turtle and {KAnalyze}. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a tested and robust {API}, and is freely available under the {BSD} license at github.com/ged-lab/khmer.},
