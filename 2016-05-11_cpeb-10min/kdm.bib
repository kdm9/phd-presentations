	abstract = {Author {SummaryRecent} advances in sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale surveys of genetic diversity in model species with a wholly or partly sequenced reference genome. However, thousands of key species, which are essential for food, health, energy, and ecology, do not have reference genomes. To accelerate their breeding cycle via marker assisted selection, high-throughput genotyping is required for these valuable species, in spite of the absence of reference genomes. Based on genotyping by sequencing ({GBS}) technology, we developed a new single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) discovery protocol, the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit ({UNEAK}), which can be widely used in any species, regardless of genome complexity or the availability of a reference genome. Here we test this protocol on switchgrass, currently the prime energy crop species in the United States of America. In addition to the discovery of over a million {SNPs} and construction of high-density linkage maps, we provide novel insights into the genome complexity, ploidy, phylogeny, and evolution of switchgrass. This is only the beginning: we believe {UNEAK} offers the key to the exploration and exploitation of the genetic diversity of thousands of non-model species.},

	abstract = {Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge ecological and economic importance. Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the {\textgreater}100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small {RNAs}, previously implicated in transposable element silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long ({\textgreater}10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding {RNAs} and short {RNAs}. This opens up new genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.},

	abstract = {Given a massive collection of sequences, it is infeasible to perform pairwise alignment for basic tasks like sequence clustering and search. To address this problem, we demonstrate that the {MinHash} technique, first applied to clustering web pages, can be applied to biological sequences with similar effect, and extend this idea to include biologically relevant distance and significance measures. Our new tool, Mash, uses {MinHash} locality-sensitive hashing to reduce large sequences to a representative sketch and rapidly estimate pairwise distances between genomes or metagenomes. Using Mash, we explored several use cases, including a 5,000-fold size reduction and clustering of all {\textasciitilde}55,000 {NCBI} {RefSeq} genomes in 46 {CPU} hours. The resulting 93 {MB} sketch database includes all {RefSeq} genomes, effectively delineates known species boundaries, reconstructs approximate phylogenies, and can be searched in seconds using assembled genomes or raw sequencing runs from Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore. For metagenomics, Mash scales to thousands of samples and can replicate Human Microbiome Project and Global Ocean Survey results in a fraction of the time. Other potential applications include any problem where an approximate, global sequence distance is acceptable, e.g. to triage and cluster sequence data, assign species labels to unknown genomes, quickly identify mis-tracked samples, and search massive genomic databases. In addition, the Mash distance metric is based on simple set intersections, which are compatible with homomorphic encryption schemes. To facilitate integration with other software, Mash is implemented as a lightweight C++ toolkit and freely released under a {BSD} license at https://github.com/marbl/mash.},

	abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, {MAFFT}, has been developed. The {CPU} time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. {MAFFT} includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform ({FFT}), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing {CPU} time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method ({FFT}-{NS}-2) and the iterative refinement method ({FFT}-{NS}-i), are implemented in {MAFFT}. The performances of {FFT}-{NS}-2 and {FFT}-{NS}-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the {CPU} time of {FFT}-{NS}-2 is drastically reduced as compared with {CLUSTALW} with comparable accuracy. {FFT}-{NS}-i is over 100 times faster than T-{COFFEE}, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

Our data support previous observations that Chlamydomonas is among the most diverse eukaryotic species. Nucleotide diversity is ∼3\% and is geographically structured in North America with some evidence of admixture among sampling locales. Examination of predicted loss-of-function mutations in field isolates indicates conservation of genes associated with core cellular functions, while genes in large gene families and poorly characterized genes show a greater incidence of major effect mutations. De novo assembly of unmapped reads recovered genes in the field isolates that are absent from the {CC}-503 assembly. The laboratory reference strains show a genomic pattern of polymorphism consistent with their origin as the recombinant progeny of a diploid zygospore. Large duplications or amplifications are a prominent feature of laboratory strains and appear to have originated under laboratory culture. Extensive natural variation offers a new source of genetic diversity for studies of Chlamydomonas, including naturally occurring alleles that may prove useful in studies of gene function and the dissection of quantitative genetic traits.},

	abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development.

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match.

Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

	abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of {DNA} sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing {GBS} libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes ({REs}). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive {REs}, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The {GBS} procedure is demonstrated with maize ({IBM}) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of {GBS} to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Restriction-site–associated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling {RADseq} loci at the phylogenetic scale.
Results: {PyRAD} is a pipeline to assemble de novo {RADseq} loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare {PyRAD} with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated {RADseq} dataset that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in {PyRAD}, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical {RADseq} dataset that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. {PyRAD} uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals.

These new options of {MAFFT} showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including {TCoffee} version 2 and {CLUSTAL} W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of {\textgreater}50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of {MAFFT} can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of ∼8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2–10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value {\textless} 10−5–10−20) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of {MAFFT} proposed here.

	abstract = {Summary: Suffix tree is one of the most fundamental data structures in string algorithms and biological sequence analysis. Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing those algorithms and applying them to real genomic sequences, often the main memory size becomes the bottleneck. This is easily explained by the fact that while a {DNA} sequence of length n from alphabet Σ = \{A, C, G, T \} can be stored in n log {\textbar}Σ{\textbar}= 2n bits, its suffix tree occupies O(n log n) bits. In practice, the size difference easily reaches factor 50.
We provide an implementation of the compressed suffix tree very recently proposed by Sadakane (Theory of Computing Systems, in press). The compressed suffix tree occupies space proportional to the text size, and supports all typical suffix tree operations with at most log n factor slowdown.

It supports merging, refinement and reclustering of clusters. It is ‘drop in’ compatible with the {StackPack} clustering package. wcd supports parallelization under both shared memory and cluster architectures. It is distributed with an {EMBOSS} wrapper allowing wcd to be installed as part of an {EMBOSS} installation (and so provided by a web server)., Availability: wcd is distributed under a {GPL} licence and is available from http://code.google.com/p/wcdest, Contact: scott.hazelhurst@wits.ac.za, Supplementary information: Additional experimental results.

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is ∼10–20× faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

	abstract = {New sequencing technologies allow genomic variation to be surveyed in much greater detail than previously possible. While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of {tagSNPs}, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency {\textgreater}0.2\%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of {\textgreater}2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ∼20\% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

	abstract = {Many algorithms for sequence analysis use patterns or spaced seeds consisting of match and don't-care positions, such that only characters at the match positions are considered when sub-words of the sequences are counted or compared. The performance of these approaches depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a pattern set that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the variance of the number of spaced-word matches between two evolutionarily related sequences, with respect to this pattern set. We propose an improved hill-climbing algorithm to optimize sets of patterns or multiple seeds for database searching, read mapping and alignment-free sequence comparison. Experimental results show that our approach generates seeds with higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our spaced-words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets calculated with {RasBhari} led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used.

Sequence alignment, a fundamental task in bioinformatics research, may be used but with some caveats. Seminal techniques and methods from dynamic programming are proving ineffective for this work owing to their inherent computational expense when processing large amounts of sequence data. These methods are prone to giving misleading information because of genetic recombination, genetic shuffling and other inherent biological events. New approaches from information theory, frequency analysis and data compression are available and provide powerful alternatives to dynamic programming. These new methods are often preferred, as their algorithms are simpler and are not affected by synteny-related problems.
In this review, we provide a detailed discussion of computational tools, which stem from alignment-free methods based on statistical analysis from word frequencies. We provide several clear examples to demonstrate applications and the interpretations over several different areas of alignment-free analysis such as base–base correlations, feature frequency profiles, compositional vectors, an improved string composition and the D2 statistic metric. Additionally, we provide detailed discussion and an example of analysis by Lempel–Ziv techniques from data compression.},

Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian {BACs}. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian {BAC}, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information.

Here, we demonstrate the applicability of {RAD} markers for both individual and bulk-segregant genotyping. First, we show that these markers can be identified and typed on pre-existing microarray formats. Second, we present a method that uses {RAD} marker {DNA} to rapidly produce a low-cost microarray genotyping resource that can be used to efficiently identify and type thousands of {RAD} markers. We demonstrate the utility of the former approach by using a tiling path array for the fruit fly to map a recombination breakpoint, and the latter approach by creating and using an enriched {RAD} marker array for the threespine stickleback. The high number of {RAD} markers enabled localization of a previously identified region, as well as a second region also associated with the lateral plate phenotype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that {RAD} markers, and the method to develop a {RAD} marker microarray resource, allow high-throughput, high-resolution genotyping in both model and nonmodel systems.},

	abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via “{SNP} chip” microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as {RAD}-tag or {RADseq}) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current {SNP} chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input {DNA}, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified {RADseq} approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

	abstract = {High-volume sequencing of {DNA} and {RNA} is now within reach of any research laboratory and is quickly becoming established as a key research tool. In many workflows, each of the short sequences (“reads”) resulting from a sequencing run are first “mapped” (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., {BWA}, Bowtie, {ELAND}) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

This review covers several aspects of {IT} applications, ranging from genome global analysis and comparison, including block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps, to local analysis, comprising the classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles. {IT} has also been applied to high-level correlations that combine {DNA}, {RNA} or protein features with sequence-independent properties, such as gene mapping and phenotype analysis, and has also provided models based on communication systems theory to describe information transmission channels at the cell level and also during evolutionary processes.
While not exhaustive, this review attempts to categorize existing methods and to indicate their relation with broader transversal topics such as genomic signatures, data compression and complexity, time series analysis and phylogenetic classification, providing a resource for future developments in this promising area.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.
Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use ‘spaced words’, defined by patterns of ‘match’ and ‘don’t care’ positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.

	abstract = {We describe a novel method for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, based on sequences of whole genomes or proteomes, whose lengths may greatly vary. The core of our method is a new measure of pairwise distances between sequences. This measure is based on computing the average lengths of maximum common substrings, which is intrinsically related to information theoretic tools (Kullback–Leibler relative entropy). We present an algorithm for efficiently computing these distances. In principle, the distance of two l long sequences can be calculated in O(l) time. We implemented the algorithm using suffix arrays our implementation is fast enough to enable the construction of the proteome phylogenomic tree for hundreds of species and the genome phylogenomic forest for almost two thousand viruses. An initial analysis of the results exhibits a remarkable agreement with "acceptable phylogenetic and taxonomic truth." To assess our approach, our results were compared to the traditional (single-gene or protein-based) maximum likelihood method. The obtained trees were compared to implementations of a number of alternative approaches, including two that were previously published in the literature, and to the published results of a third approach. Comparing their outcome and running time to ours, using a "traditional" trees and a standard tree comparison method, our algorithm improved upon the "competition" by a substantial margin. The simplicity and speed of our method allows for a whole genome analysis with the greatest scope attempted so far. We describe here five different applications of the method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies have become the standard for data generation in studies of population genomics, as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of {NGS} data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five {HLA} genes ({HLA}-A, -B, -C, -{DRB}1, and -{DQB}1). We take advantage of the availability of {HLA} Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6\% of {SNP} genotype calls in {HLA} genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than ±0.1 at approximately 25\% of the {SNPs} in {HLA} genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the {HLA} region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of {NGS} data at other genomic regions of high diversity.},

One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or l-mer) frequency profiles ({FFP}) of whole genomes are used for comparison—a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of l-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum {FFP} method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized {FFP} method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the {FFP} derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phylogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-based methods for sequence analysis have various limitations if large data sets are to be analysed. Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring ({ACS}) approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays.
Results: To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of {DNA} and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods which are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood.

The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

	abstract = {Restriction site-associated {DNA} sequencing or genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) approaches allow for rapid and cost-effective discovery and genotyping of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in multiple individuals. However, rigorous quality control practices are needed to avoid high levels of error and bias with these reduced representation methods. We developed a formal statistical framework for filtering spurious loci, using Mendelian inheritance patterns in nuclear families, that accommodates variable-quality genotype calls and missing data—both rampant issues with {GBS} data—and for identifying sex-linked {SNPs}. Simulations predict excellent performance of both the Mendelian filter and the sex-linkage assignment under a variety of conditions. We further evaluate our method by applying it to real {GBS} data and validating a subset of high-quality {SNPs}. These results demonstrate that our metric of Mendelian inheritance is a powerful quality filter for {GBS} loci that is complementary to standard coverage and Hardy–Weinberg filters. The described method, implemented in the software {MendelChecker}, will improve quality control during {SNP} discovery in nonmodel as well as model organisms.},

We developed a physical map of 4.98 Gb, with more than 3.90 Gb anchored to a high-resolution genetic map. Projecting a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, complementary {DNA} and deep {RNA} sequence data onto this framework supports 79,379 transcript clusters, including 26,159 ‘high-confidence’ genes with homology support from other plant genomes. Abundant alternative splicing, premature termination codons and novel transcriptionally active regions suggest that post-transcriptional processing forms an important regulatory layer. Survey sequences from diverse accessions reveal a landscape of extensive single-nucleotide variation. Our data provide a platform for both genome-assisted research and enabling contemporary crop improvement.},

Recent genome-wide association and metabolic profiling studies aimed to resolve quantitative traits to their causal genetic loci and key metabolic regulators. Here we present a complementary approach that exploits large-scale genomic and metabolic information to predict complex, highly polygenic traits in hybrid testcrosses. We crossed 285 diverse Dent inbred lines from worldwide sources with two testers and predicted their combining abilities for seven biomass-and bioenergy-related traits using 56,110 {SNPs} and 130 metabolites. Whole-genome and metabolic prediction models were built by fitting effects for all {SNPs} or metabolites. Prediction accuracies ranged from 0.72 to 0.81 for {SNPs} and from 0.60 to 0.80 for metabolites, allowing a reliable screening of large collections of diverse inbred lines for their potential to create superior hybrids. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

	abstract = {{SNP} genotyping arrays have been useful for many applications that require a large number of molecular markers such as high-density genetic mapping, genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}), and genomic selection. We report the establishment of a large maize {SNP} array and its use for diversity analysis and high density linkage mapping. The markers, taken from more than 800,000 {SNPs}, were selected to be preferentially located in genes and evenly distributed across the genome. The array was tested with a set of maize germplasm including North American and European inbred lines, parent/F1 combinations, and distantly related teosinte material. A total of 49,585 markers, including 33,417 within 17,520 different genes and 16,168 outside genes, were of good quality for genotyping, with an average failure rate of 4\% and rates up to 8\% in specific germplasm. To demonstrate this array's use in genetic mapping and for the independent validation of the B73 sequence assembly, two intermated maize recombinant inbred line populations – {IBM} (B73×Mo17) and {LHRF} (F2×F252) – were genotyped to establish two high density linkage maps with 20,913 and 14,524 markers respectively. 172 mapped markers were absent in the current B73 assembly and their placement can be used for future improvements of the B73 reference sequence. Colinearity of the genetic and physical maps was mostly conserved with some exceptions that suggest errors in the B73 assembly. Five major regions containing non-colinearities were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, and are supported by both independent genetic maps. Four additional non-colinear regions were found on the {LHRF} map only; they may be due to a lower density of {IBM} markers in those regions or to true structural rearrangements between lines. Given the array's high quality, it will be a valuable resource for maize genetics and many aspects of maize breeding.},

	abstract = {Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to next-generation sequencing approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) has been developed as a tool for association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. {GBS} uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a {GBS} approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme {GBS} protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified {SNPs} and tags. We were able to map over 34,000 {SNPs} and 240,000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20,000 {SNPs} and 367,000 tags on the Synthetic W9784×Opata85 ({SynOpDH}) wheat reference map. To further evaluate {GBS} in wheat, we also constructed a  de novo  genetic map using only {SNP} markers from the {GBS} data. The {GBS} approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of {GBS} data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, {GBS} will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs.},
